* Draw kilt shapes
* Guideline analysis
Apron/Pleat Scenarios

MudShark666: "I'm still a bit curious how the hip/waist measures is carried over to the pleat? The pleat designer only have a hip measure..." - Ask!

Fix error message (trailing ')') - simple fractions only (at most one '/')
* Should Value really have .error types? Ok for computation but not I/O
* Use new formatter approach throughout calculator & UI
* May need 8th-fraction formatter or accept unitless values as inches

* Save scenarios

* Idea: show memory value in history too


History
* Print history
  + https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-print-using-uiactivityviewcontroller
  + https://thomas.skowron.eu/blog/printing-with-swiftui/
* Let users type into history?
* Store history, restore on app restart

Syntax
* Make calculator have a state machine for valid expressions (not including balancing parentheses) - or state machine plus parenthesis counter
* Disable calculator buttons that can't be used (e.g., no ')' if there's not been a '(')
* Ways to show parends need work - hint counter? grayed-out right parends? long press to close all? automatically insert?
* If you start with an operator, you should load the previous result as the first operand (?) - or pointing hand to previous result?

* Dark or light mode (remove ContentView .preferredColorScheme(.light))

* Accessibility
* I18N

* Figure out ObservableObjects being observed by other ObservableObjects

CALC-23-50: 2023-09-04 - Apron/Pleat Scenarios
Apron/Pleat screen:
* Make warning messages wrap, left-justified
* ScrollView on splits
* Warn if apron width at hips < apron width at waist
* Warn if >4" difference between waist and hip at apron
* Reverse sliders to give or take from apron (more natural)

CALC-23-49: 2023-08-17 - Managing Scenarios
* Monitor waist and hips; changes => change in scenarios
* Button to add scenario
* A/P Split tables and scenario view
  + Show the table

* MeasurementTable should know about nullable values

CALC-23-47: 2023-08-15 - Upgrade EGTest
EGTest
* Create EGAssertThrowsError()
* Update EGTest to take new check() with try
* Let check() use varargs rather than []

Apron/Pleats
* Created a MeasurementView with a grid (table)
* Created KiltMeasures, enforced rule about ideal hips >= waist

CALC-23-46: 2023-08-14 - Improve ValueFormatter
Formatting
* FractionFormatter.format - let its computation move into SplitDouble.fractionParts
  "MudShark666: I think the you only needed the check before the +- bit"
* How much is a skosh?   6/8+ could be 6/8..<6/8+1/32
  If it's .7500001 we call it 6/8+
* Should we do a Double formatter that handles fractions? Not now.

EGTest
* Update EGTest with EGAssert - EGAssert(actual, eg)

CALC-23-45: 2023-08-09 - Formatting and EGTest
* Remember the last tab and go back to it on startup [should have done this weeks ago]
* Decimal inches formatter in calculator [dropped]
* Adjust how skosh is set
Was this:
|+++++++++++++++++++++ ---------------------|
2/16   2/16+1/64 2/16+2/64  2/16+3/64      3/16

Now this:
|      +++++++++++++++ --------------       |
2/16   2/16+1/64 2/16+2/64  2/16+3/64      3/16

* Gap and total fabric to show fractional inches

CALC-23-37: 2023-07-27 - Simplify PleatDesigner Types
* Make count an int in pleat equations and designer
* Make pleat designer calculations use doubles where we don't need value-style parsing
* Do we need to check for error values in pleat designer? No

CALC-23-35: 2023-07-25 - Military Box Pleat
* Make drawings for tartan and pleats, as well as adjusting military-style box pleat picture
* Make pleat width drawing adjustable (ideally animated): overlaps

* Store original hip
* Calculate pleat or pleat-width adjustment using original hip

CALC-23-33: 2023-07-19
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61073146/swiftui-validate-input-in-textfields
* Add focus tracking back to each field so internal & external update correctly
  + Failing test case: hip=20, sett=6 => 20/2.  Change pleat width to 3, it changes hip to 30 and #pleats to 15 AND pleat width to 2 - but expected #pleats = 10 - Fixed
  + Fields don't adjust when the bound value changes - Fixed
* Make pleat count update pleat width and possibly hip measure
  + How do we update pleat count when pleat width changes? What if pleat count is nil? - check for pleat > fabric
* Make pleat width update pleat count and possibly hip measure
* Delete dead code in PleatValidator.requiredSmaller
* Handle switch in focus to display final value
* Make ValidatingTextField only track its own focus state
* "/" key added to keyboard

CALC-23-32: 2023-07-18 - Working on Validation

* Make ValidatingTextField track its focus state

CALC-23-31: 2023-07-17
* Create a ValidatingTextField
* Handle parser errors in pleat designer textfields
  - split parser validation and value validation, but have an error string that shows whichever is present
* Make existing fields use ValidatingTextField: Hip, sett, setts/pleat

CALC-23-30: 2023-07-13 - Throw in PleatDesigner
* Devise an approach to validating a field - catching both parse errors and semantic errors
  - We're closing in on it

CALC-23-29: 2023-07-12 - Throw or Value.error?

CALC-23-28: 2023-07-10 - Textfield with Fractions
* [bonus session] Debugged issue with yard-feet-inch formatter not working
* [off camera] Hip can flex, #pleats stays a whole number (user feedback)
* Failed attempt to make the field() generic over int or double
* Input vs output format: must be able to re-parse any output - fixed problems with circled + and -, and bullet point

* Make Value's parser conform to ParseStrategy
* Add ValueFormatStyle inside Value
* Make ValueFormatStyle support ParseableFormatStyle

* Fix it so value formatter uses the right formatter [bonus session]

CALC-23-26: 2023-07-05 - Pleat Errors
* Gap vs overlap - negative gap is an overlap (change the label & show the absolute value)
* negative values for any required values, #pleats, pleat width
* pleat width must be < sett*sett/pleat
* non-integral pleat count

CALC-23-25: 2023-07-04 - Pleat Width and Count

* Make HistoryItem hold one string only
* Make M+ add "↳ M+" to history
* Change history to put =>M+ at end of line for M+
* M-

Error Reporting

* [off camera] Add !today command to twitch stream

Memory Keys
* M+ and MR - for integers - add a .value Entry

CALC-23-15: 2023-06-15 - Rounding Units
[off camera] Gave CalculatorTests a mini-language for expressions (like ContentViewTests has); switched to EG tests
[off camera] Made EGAssert that takes actual value and EG
[off camera] Added background

* Added a one-expression history display
* Tweaked look of background and buttons

CALC-23-14: 2023-06-14 - Rounding to 8ths and 16ths

Rounding
* Rounding picker (1/8, 1/16 to start)
* Rounding to 8ths mostly done - still need to test corner cases
* [Off camera: make CalculatorTests use number() where it simplifies tests]

CALC-23-12: 2023-06-12 - (Unbalanced Parentheses))
* Parenthesis error checking
* Make evaluate pull sequence of number and unit into a value, so all the operators don't have to check for it
* Did a little exploration of why UI tests are slow (inconclusive)
* Add a picker for "show as" - either inches or yards-feet-inches (UI only)

CALC-23-11: 2023-06-07 - Negation
* Remove Operator.make()
* Plus-or-minus -  5 +/- => -5

CALC-23-07: 2023-05-31 - Full Unit Input
* Make Keypad a struct
* Try to eliminate purple runtime errors by removing @StateObject from ContentViewTests
* Add spaces before and after units
* Make "ft 3 in 2" == "3 ft 2 in" for input
* "ft=" should be error
* What about "3 yd ft 2 in"? (Should only take last unit)
* What about "5 ft 2" - is an error
* Show most recent operator in the display
* If you hit two operators in a row, the last one should win
* Developed an input buffer, with simple editing, that captures the whole expression

CALC-23-06: 2023-05-30 - Associativity
