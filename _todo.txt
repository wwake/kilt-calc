* Convert pleat designer to work in Value, not int/double
* Make round() a method on value, abs, <
* Check that pleatCount is integral
* Should 1.2.3 produce 1-2/3? Fits with decimal pad, just as non-standard as / :) - or "/" above numeric pad
* How to show error
* Use new formatter approach throughout calculator & UI
* May need 8th-fraction formatter or accept unitless values as int

* Refactor!! :)
Editing fractions in TextField

* Remember the last tab and go back to it on startup

* Compute labeled picture from form changes (animate?)

* A/P: Apron/Pleat

* Save scenarios

* Idea: show memory value in history too

* Comma in long numbers

History
* Print history
  + https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-print-using-uiactivityviewcontroller
  + https://thomas.skowron.eu/blog/printing-with-swiftui/
* Let users type into history?
* Store history, restore on app restart

Syntax
* Make calculator have a state machine for valid expressions (not including balancing parentheses) - or state machine plus parenthesis counter
* Disable calculator buttons that can't be used (e.g., no ')' if there's not been a '(')
* Ways to show parends need work - hint counter? grayed-out right parends? long press to close all? automatically insert?
* If you start with an operator, you should load the previous result as the first operand (?) - or pointing hand to previous result?

* Dark or light mode (remove ContentView .preferredColorScheme(.light))

* Accessibility
* I18N

EGTest
* Update EGTest to take new check() with try from ContentViewTests
* Update EGTest with EGAssert
* Add EGAssert(actual, eg)
* Let check use varargs rather than []

CALC-23-28: 2023-07-10 - Textfield with Fractions
* [bonus session] Debugged issue with yard-feet-inch formatter not working
* [off camera] Hip can flex, #pleats stays a whole number (user feedback)
* Failed attempt to make the field() generic over int or double
* Input vs output format: must be able to re-parse any output - fixed problems with circled + and -, and bullet point
* Use new parser setup with Hip to Hip measure - now working as a Value

CALC-23-27: 2023-07-06 - Fractions on the Pleat Tab
* Make Value's parser conform to ParseStrategy
* Add ValueFormatStyle inside Value
* Make ValueFormatStyle support ParseableFormatStyle
* Try to switch UI to use the new approach [got stuck debugging at end of session]
* Fix it so value formatter uses the right formatter [bonus session]

CALC-23-26: 2023-07-05 - Pleat Errors
* Gap vs overlap - negative gap is an overlap (change the label & show the absolute value)
* negative values for any required values, #pleats, pleat width
* pleat width must be < sett*sett/pleat
* non-integral pleat count

CALC-23-25: 2023-07-04 - Pleat Width and Count
* [off camera] Tweak button look, add animation, and add empty page for Apron/Pleat
* Calculate gap and pleatFabric on demand
* Straighten out pleatWidth and pleatCount for cases where nil involved
* Calculate total yardage for pleats
* Messages - Identify the type of pleat (box pleat etc.)
* Show message when error string non-empty

CALC-23-24: 2023-07-03 - Box Pleat Constraints
* Is gap an output only? Yes
* Make Calculator and Pleats be separate tabs
* Set the sett, settsPerPleat, and hip - required fields

* We left off drawing extension lines for it

CALC-23-21: 2023-06-27 - Memory Errors
Memory Keys
* M+ / M- shouldn't mix numbers & units - report error
* M+ error messages to message field; shown as alert
* Make HistoryItem hold one string only
* Make M+ add "↳ M+" to history
* Change history to put =>M+ at end of line for M+
* M-

Error Reporting
* Error messages to errorMessage in Calculator
* How do error messages interact with history? No history when there was an error, and input still there so you can revise it

CALC-23-20: 2023-06-26 - Memory Keys
* [off camera] Add !today command to twitch stream

Memory Keys
* M+ and MR - for integers - add a .value Entry
* Handle zero mixed with units

CALC-23-15: 2023-06-15 - Rounding Units
[off camera] Gave CalculatorTests a mini-language for expressions (like ContentViewTests has); switched to EG tests
[off camera] Made EGAssert that takes actual value and EG
[off camera] Added background
* Rounding: Make unit formatter use the new numeric formatting
* Added a one-expression history display
* Tweaked look of background and buttons

CALC-23-14: 2023-06-14 - Rounding to 8ths and 16ths
* modf
* Round to 8ths and 16ths
* Rounding should be to 16ths, but simplifying any even 8ths (12/16 => 6/8)
* Show "skosh" characters - ⊕ (rounded down), ⊖ (rounded up)

CALC-23-13: 2023-06-13 - Choose Units for Display
* [Off camera: Tweak "Show As" wording]
* [Off camera: rename to KiltCalc]
* [Off camera: Add onDisplay() as per ViewInspector instructions about @State - but still have intermittent failures]

Unit Display
* Set unit display format with picker; default to inches

Rounding
* Rounding picker (1/8, 1/16 to start)
* Rounding to 8ths mostly done - still need to test corner cases
* [Off camera: make CalculatorTests use number() where it simplifies tests]

CALC-23-12: 2023-06-12 - (Unbalanced Parentheses))
* Parenthesis error checking
* Make evaluate pull sequence of number and unit into a value, so all the operators don't have to check for it
* Did a little exploration of why UI tests are slow (inconclusive)
* Add a picker for "show as" - either inches or yards-feet-inches (UI only)

CALC-23-11: 2023-06-07 - Negation
* Remove Operator.make()
* Plus-or-minus -  5 +/- => -5
* Error for +/- first or after an operator

* Reorganize Keypad to return an Entry, Calculator to use it and store it in InputBuffer.
* Display negative numbers - 0in-17in=  -1 ft -5 in
* Started moving Operator into Entry

CALC-23-08: 2023-06-01 - Parse and Evaluate at '='
* Change input as String to [String]
* Change input to be a Stack<String>
* Type the whole expression before = evaluates
* Eliminate pending & lastOperator in Calculator
* Introduced Expression and InputBuffer types
* No purple errors today, so we're assuming we've fixed it

CALC-23-07: 2023-05-31 - Full Unit Input
* Make Keypad a struct
* Try to eliminate purple runtime errors by removing @StateObject from ContentViewTests
* Add spaces before and after units
* Make "ft 3 in 2" == "3 ft 2 in" for input
* "ft=" should be error
* What about "3 yd ft 2 in"? (Should only take last unit)
* What about "5 ft 2" - is an error
* Show most recent operator in the display
* If you hit two operators in a row, the last one should win
* Developed an input buffer, with simple editing, that captures the whole expression

CALC-23-06: 2023-05-30 - Associativity
* [Off camera] Improve system tests to accept all keystrokes and show file/line of errors
* Simplify Value.plus
* Stack object
* Operator objects
* Subtraction - check that associativity is correct
* Multiplication - check that precedence is correct
